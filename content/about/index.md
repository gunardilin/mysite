I am Gunar, born in Jakarta, Indonesia and living in Munich, Germany. I have been working in automobile industry as {{< rawhtml >}}<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_lifecycle" target="_blank">PLM</a>{{< /rawhtml >}} -Engineer specializing in mechanical construction using systems like {{< rawhtml >}}<a href="https://www.ptc.com/en/products/windchill" target="_blank">Windchill</a>{{< /rawhtml >}} and {{< rawhtml >}}<a href="https://www.3ds.com/products-services/catia/" target="_blank">CATIA</a>{{< /rawhtml >}}. 

During Covid lockdown, I have found a new passion: solving problems using Python programming language. Since then I embarked on a journey to be a better problem solver. With the time goes on, my interest in Data Analytic and Machine Learning is growing. Up until a certain point, I enrolled in multiple different online courses. But since my decision in August 2022 to learn about these topics in a correct manner (hard way), I decided to go back to university to {{< rawhtml >}}<a href="https://www.hs-harz.de/data-science-berufsbegleitend" target="_blank">study Data Science as part time student</a>{{< /rawhtml >}}, while working full time. It has been an uphill journey, luckily I enjoy experimenting and learning data science. I learn the best by doing project, that's why I'm glad to get project assignments during my study. In my first semester, I did a {{< rawhtml >}}<a href="/post/project-4" target="_blank">natural language processing project</a>{{< /rawhtml >}} and for my second semester (summer 2023), I am doing an analytic project with computer vision.
