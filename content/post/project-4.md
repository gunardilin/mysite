In this project, I collected ~260.000 text data to figure out the current trend of security-related topics. Due to huge amount of text data, an unsupervised topic discovery algorithm is applied, i.e. Latent Dirichlet Algorithm (LDA). Before applying LDA, it is necessary to preprocess text data and convert it to be compatible as input for LDA. Furthermore I also did data exploratory analysis to figure out the general trend of security topics and general other programming topics.
