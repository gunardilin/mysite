I am Gunar, born in Jakarta, Indonesia and living in Munich, Germany. I have been working in automobile industry as [PLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_lifecycle)-Engineer specializing in mechanical construction using systems like [Windchill](https://www.ptc.com/en/products/windchill) and [CATIA](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/catia/). 

During Covid lockdown, I have found a new passion: solving problems using Python programming language. Since then I embarked on a journey to be a better problem solver. With the time goes on, my interest in Data Analytic and Machine Learning is growing. Up until a certain point, I enrolled in multiple different online courses. But since my decision in August 2022 to learn about these topics in a correct manner (hard way), I decided to go back to university to [study Data Science as part time student](https://www.hs-harz.de/data-science-berufsbegleitend), while working full time. It requires discipline and some times it could get hard and frustrating. But I haven't regretted once about it. If any, I get sometimes disappointed not to be able to learn or understand things faster. But I remind myself, this is a Marathon, instead of a Sprint and I intend to finish it.
