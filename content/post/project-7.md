# Description:
In this Medium article {{< rawhtml >}} 
  <a href="https://medium.com/dev-genius/it-has-never-been-easier-to-build-your-own-personal-website-f6974eb4ec1d"><img src="/images/siteimages/link_icon.png" style="width:20px;height:20px;"></a>
{{< /rawhtml >}}, I describe how to generate a website and deploy it by using Hugo framework. Hugo framework is in my opinion undeservingly underrated.
